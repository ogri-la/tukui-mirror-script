# Tukui mirror script

Takes `tukui` and `elvui` releases and hosts them on Github where they can be incorporated into a catalogue of other 
addons hosted on Github.

tukui.org support has been removed from Strongbox after tukui.org stopped hosting addons other than `tukui` and `elvui`, 
changed the location and behaviour of the API.

Their API, their rules, but two addons is too small for especial support in Strongbox.
